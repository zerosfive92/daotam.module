= Pretty Links =

Pretty Links enables you to shorten links using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, bit.ly, or any other link shrinking service)! In addition to creating clean links, Pretty Links tracks each hit on your URL and provides a full, detailed report of where the hit came from, the browser, os and host. Pretty Links is a killer plugin for people who want to clean up their affiliate links, track clicks from emails, their links on Twitter to come from their own domain, or generally increase the reach of their website by spreading these links on forums or comments on other blogs.

= Link Examples =

This is a link setup using Pretty Links that redirects to the Pretty Links Homepage where you can find more info about this Plugin:

Here's a named pretty link (I used the slug 'aweber') that does a 307 redirect to my affiliate link for aweber.com:

http://blairwilliams.com/aweber

Here's a link that Pretty Links generated a random slug for (similar to what bit.ly or tinyurl would do):

= Features =

* Gives you the ability to create clean, simple URLs on your website that redirect to any other URL (allows for 301, 302, and 307 redirects only)

* Tracks the Number of Clicks per link

* Download hit details in CSV format
* Intuitive Javascript / AJAX Admin User Interface

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'pretty-link.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from "Default" to something else. I prefer using custom and then "/%year%/%month%/%postname%/" for the simplest possible URL slugs with the best performance.
